Original question:
    Social media on a mobile platform is like TOTALLY AWESOME MAN! It's gonna
    change design big time. Discuss!

- Exploration in theory
    - theoretical work that has been produced to support or disprove
    a particular argument
- Explanation in practice
    - ways in which these concepts manifest themselves in reality
- A critique of both the theory, practice and their relationship
    - pros, cons and recommendations

8-part Formula
==============

Intro
-----

1. Introduction
    - Rewrite and expand on the essay title, identify the main assertion of
    the question
    - Contextualise the main issue
    - Suggest what standpoint you are going to take in the essay
    - Indicate *how* you are going to answer the question
    - Just a little hint at the conclusions (write the intro LAST!)

Main
----

2. General comments and definitions of the words used (kind of like
   a background section)
3. Explain any theory underpinning your argument, and how it's relevant
4. Give evidence that exists to support/add weight to theoretical
   assertions

5. Present your argument in more detail, with evidence and examples taken
   empirically (referencing what you said in parts 2-4)
6. Critique the arguments you put forward in 2-5, including limitations and
   constraints of them
7. Offer alternative perspective (i.e. your opinion) and provide evidence to back it up
    - How will social/new media impact on design in the future? Speculate on the
    future of design, bearing in mind the fact that these techs. are now dominant

Conclusion
----------

8. Restate what you found, place central argument within a wider context
   and summarise

The MARK SCHEME!
================

1. Answer the question, boy!
    - Don't write a nice essay on the wrong subject
    - Think about whether the answer is complete, whether there is any
    irrelevant material, and if you have included examples which are asked for
2. Demonstrate knowledge
    - The podcasts provide a lot of info about this
    - Choose sources of information carefully
    - All facts and figures should be referenced with evidence
    - Provide high quality arguments to state your case
3. Critical thinking
    - Discuss the issues in detail, and how these emerging technologies will
    impact on designs of the future
    - Show originality in your thought and demonstrate
4. Presentation
    - Use a good structure: beginning, middle and end!
    - One sentence = one point, one paragraph = one idea
    - Proof read!
